                        This year's 15th edition of the analysis reconfirms earlier results: less developed countries
                        are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Those are:

                        <br>
                        Japan / Philippines / Germany / Madagascar / India / Sri Lanka / Kenya / Rwanda / Canada / Fiji

                    <p>
                        Regarding the future, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing
                        vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more
                        frequent or more severe, due to climate change.
                        Nonetheless, the 2018 heatwaves and droughts also proved that high income countries feel climate
                        impacts more clearly than ever before. Effective climate change mitigation is therefore in the
                        self-interest of all countries worldwide.

                    <h2>Issue Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of millions of years, the global climate has experienced fluctuations. Since the
                        beginning of industrialisation, however, the composition of the atmosphere has changed
                        above-​average as a result of greenhouse gas emissions. This global warming intensifies the
                        natural greenhouse effect and is leading to detectable changes to the climate, also having a
                        significant effect on people and nature. A failure to act today will deeply affect the future of
                        the Earth, since effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result, are now
                        occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
                        Plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>How much global warming is really caused by humans?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The global warming of the last 50 years is, with over 95% probability, due to humans. Human
                        activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, are altering the climate system.
                        But changes in land use, and land cover such as deforestation, urbanization, and shifts in
                        vegetation patterns also alter the climate, resulting in changes to the reflectivity of the
                        Earth surface, emissions from burning forests, urban heat island effects and changes in the
                        natural water cycle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to CO₂, methane and nitrous oxide are two of the most important greenhouse
                        gases, and the annual emissions are greatly increased by human activities. Methane emissions are
                        particularly dominant in the area of livestock farming. Thawing permafrost, as a direct
                        consequence of the rising global temperatures, thus represents a significant source of
                        greenhouse gases in the form of methane emissions. The main source of emissions of nitrous oxide
                        can also be found in the area of agriculture, related to the use of nitrogen fertilisers.

                        <strong>What are the consequences of climate change? How is it turning into an urgent
                            crisis?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Those consequences directly affect both us humans and our environment: 
                        <br>

                        <li>Increase in hunger and water crises, especially in developing countries;</li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>
                    <p>
                        The impacts of climate change affect every country on every continent. Hoewever, the people
                        least responsible for global garming will suffer the most from its consequences: poor and
                        vulnerable countries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, shifting seasons, and natural disasters
                        disproportionately threaten these populations, as billions of smallholder farmers, herders and
                        fisheries, who depend on the climate and natural resources for food and income, will struggle
                        even more, increasing their risk and their dependency on humanitarian aid. The increased
                        frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires and droughts
                        threaten the world's food supply, drive people from their homes, separate families and
                        jeopardise livelihoods. And all of these effects increase the risk of conflict, hunger and
                        poverty.

                        <strong>How to reduce climate injustice?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, the inequality and climate injustice are increasingly at the heart of climate
                        negotiations. In the Kyoto Protocol, and then in the Paris Agreement, world leaders have also
                        agreed to establish the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”. Each country is
                        indeed responsible for the fight against global warming – but those who have contributed the
                        most to the problem must contribute with more means to the cause, although for the moment, this
                        principle is still very hard to apply, due to difficulties in finding investment funds.
