                    <h3>Most Affected Areas</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mental health disorders remain widely under-reported. This is true across all countries, but particularly at lower incomes, where data is scarcer, and there is less attention for mental health disorders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>In which countries does mental health have the most impact?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence, the number of people afflicted by mental ill-health rises to approximately one in five people (22.1%). And some segments of the population
                        are disproportionality affected: women and children who have experienced violence, soldiers returning from war, migrants and refugees displaced by conflict, the poor, and other vulnerable groups in society, such as the unemployed.
                        In low- and middle-income countries, between 76% and 85% of people with mental disorders receive no treatment.

                    <h2>Issue Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many different mental disorders, with different presentations. They are generally
                        characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviour and
                        relationships with others.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On a global perspective, mental disorders can include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depression;</li>
                        <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>
                        <li>Bipolar Disorder;</li>
                        <li>Schizophrenia and other Psychoses;</li>
                        <li>Dementia;</li>
                        <li>Developmental Disorders, including Autism.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on health and major
                        social, human rights and economic consequences in all countries of the world.
                        There are effective treatments for mental disorders and ways to alleviate the suffering caused
                        by them. Access to health care and social services capable of providing treatment and social
                        support is
                        key.

                        <strong>Who is at risk from mental disorders?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Determinants of mental health include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Individual attributes such as the ability to manage one's thoughts, emotions, behaviours and
                            interactions with others;</li>
                        <li>Social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors such as national policies,
                            social protection, standards of living, working conditions, and community support;</li>
                        <li>Stress, genetics, nutrition, perinatal infections and exposure to environmental hazards.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The stigma</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Many people with serious mental illness are challenged doubly. On one hand, they struggle with
                        the symptoms and disabilities that result from the disease. On the other, they are challenged by
                        the stereotypes and prejudice that result from misconceptions about mental illness. As a result
                        of both, people with mental illness are robbed of the opportunities that define a quality life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Some of the harmful effects of stigma can include:</strong>
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reluctance to seek help or treatment;</li>
                        <li>Lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others;</li>
                        <li>Fewer opportunities for work, school or social activities or trouble finding housing;</li>
                        <li>Bullying, physical violence or harassment;</li>
                        <li>Health insurance that doesn't adequately cover your mental illness treatment;</li>
                        <li>The belief that you'll never succeed or that you can't improve your situation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Ways you can deal with stigma:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get treatment. Don't let the fear of being labeled with a mental illness prevent you from seeking help. Treatment can provide relief by identifying what's wrong and reducing symptoms that interfere with your work and personal life. Don't let stigma create self-doubt and shame. You may mistakenly believe that your condition is a sign of personal weakness or that you should be able to control it without help;</li>
                        <li>Don't isolate yourself. If you have a mental illness, you may be reluctant to tell anyone about it. Your family, friends or members of your community can offer you support if they know about your mental illness. Reach out to people you trust for the compassion, support and understanding;</li>
                        <li>Don't equate yourself with your illness. You are not an illness. So instead of saying "I'm bipolar", say "I have bipolar disorder";</li>
                        <li>Join a support group;</li>
                        <li>Get help at school. If you or your child has a mental illness that affects learning, find out
                        what
                        plans and programs might help. Discrimination against students because of a mental illness is
                        against the law, and educators at primary, secondary and college levels are required to
                        accommodate
                        students as best they can. If a teacher doesn't know about a student's disability, it can lead to
                        discrimination, barriers to learning and poor grades;</li>
                        <li>Speak out against stigma. Consider expressing your opinions at events, in letters to the editor
                        or
                        on the internet. It can help instill courage in others facing similar challenges and educate the
                        public about mental illness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mental health is not only limited to persons with severe mental disorders confined to psychiatric hospitals. It is a widespread but often “invisible” phenomenon. Many of us have felt a sense of loss or detachment from families, friends and regular routines. We may also have experienced nervousness and anxiety about changes in our personal and professional lives, as well as real or imagined fears and worries that have confused and agitated us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mental health disorders account for several of the top causes of disability in established market economies. Persons with mental and psychosocial disabilities represent a significant proportion of the world’s population with special needs. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that millions of people have mental disorders, and that one in four people globally will experience a mental disorder in their lifetime. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Moreover, almost one million people die each year due to suicide, which is the third leading cause of death among young people. And most people who commit suicide have a diagnosable mental disorder. Four times as many men than women commit suicide. However, women attempt suicide more often than men. Improving awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health.
