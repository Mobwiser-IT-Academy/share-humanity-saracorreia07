                    <h3>Most Affected Areas</h3>
                    <p>
                        Multinational companies arrive in developing countries, where the workforce is already very
                        cheap. Then, they ask local businesses and factories to get even cheaper production so they can
                        offer more competent prices. If the country doesn’t accept these terms, they are risking the
                        industry to leave and be poorer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The top clothing exporting countries include China, India, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        An example of it, was the city of Phom Denh, in Cambodia, that sadly became famous because of
                        the protests occurred in 2014. While they were claiming a minimum wage of 160$ per month,
                        multiple police attacks happened to stop them and converting the place in a battleground for
                        days: 5 killed worker, 24 people arrested, and over 40 injured.

                    <p>
                        Fashion brands want consumers to buy as much clothing as quickly as possible. In the western
                        world, there are 52 seasons in fashion; one season for each week of the year. Brands can offer
                        cheap clothing, which allows us to throw away clothes without thinking about the consequences,
                        while making us believe we are wealthy or rich because we can buy a lot, by getting a $5
                        t-shirt. Because of that, today we buy a 400% more than two decades ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>What's the impact?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Only Americans throw in the rubbish 82 pounds of textile waste each year. Most of this waste is
                        non-biodegradable, and will be sitting in the landfill for 200 years or more, releasing harmful
                        gases into the air.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The cost clothes have in the use of resources such as water, land, chemicals, or gas emissions
                        is immense.
                        Only in Texas, USA, there are fields of over 3,6 million acres, forming the
                        most significant cotton patch in the world. In the past 10 years, 80% have turned out to be GMO
                        (Genetically Modified) cotton.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well, the farms instead of spot spraying the weed occasionally, or hiring laborers to walk
                        the field and eliminate the weeds, are now spraying the whole fields. There’s no natural growth
                        of the plant, and the land becomes a factory. Fertilizers or pesticides are equal to ecological
                        narcotics. The more they are used, the more they are needed, contaminating the soil.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Other consequences are the contamination of rivers. In Kanpur, India (the most
                        prominent export capital), the river Ganga, the holiest river, is contaminated with Chromium, a
                        component that attacks the liver directly making the water not drinkable. But the vegetables are
                        produced with water... which in turn create a rise in congenital disabilities, cancers and
                        mental illness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>What needs to happen?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Donating clothes to charity doesn’t solve excess of fashion. It turns out that only 10% of
                        donated clothes get sold. If the charity cannot sell them, they pack and ship them to third
                        countries. Most of them end up in Haiti, which has caused their clothing industry to disappear.

                        A positive fact is that there is a considerable amount of brands emerging to work towards
                        sustainable and ethical fashion, which hopefully will lead to creating the change the world
                        needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>What can we do in everyday life to promote sustainable fashion?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consume less and better is one simple step to change the way the industry
                            works;</li>
                        <li>Support companies that produce clothing in a way that is less harmful to
                            the environment and the people making the clothes, it sends a message to the bigger fast
                            fashion companies about what people really want;</li>
                        <li>Shop second hand, in order to extend the lives of these already worn and purchased items;
                        </li>
                        <li>Recycle or donate clothes that you have already purchased, to have a positive impact on the
                            life cycle of the items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Extending the life of an item or creating a closed loop system for clothes will help decrease
                        the
                        number of textiles that end up in the landfill.
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How is the clothing industry able to produce so fast and cheap?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first reason is that we no longer produce our clothing in Europe or the United States, only
                        3%. The remaining 97% of outsourcing is going to developing countries around the world, as they
                        often have lower wages and do
                        not have the environment legislature in place to stop the negative effects of clothing
                        production.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Around 40 million people in the world are working at the garment factory,from which 4 million
                        people are located in Bangladesh. Also, over 85% are women, with a minimum wage of $3/ a day,
                        the lowest paid garment workers in the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These multinationals create jobs for people with no other options than sewing clothes, who are
                        left to deal with consequences such as factory disasters, low wages, children and their own
                        exploitation. These underdeveloped countries want the business so badly that they have no other
                        option than cut corners in management and safety to reach the requested threshold, which has
                        lead to disasters such as the one happened in 2013 in Rana Plaza (Bangladesh, India), where over
                        1,129 people died.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately, these dangerous practices are not uncommon. Many garment workers speak of
                        managers that beat them when trying to create worker’s unions and windows that are barred shut.
