                    <h3>Most Affected Areas</h3>
                    <p>
                        Across the globe, hundreds of millions of children are being denied their dignity, freedom,
                        future and childhood. The International Labour Organization estimates that 218 million children
                        are working as
                        child labourers around the world. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But the violation of children’s rights is not just an issue in poor, developing nations. While
                        less prevalent, even high-income countries like Australia, Canada and the US fail to uphold the
                        human rights of all children; many still experience poverty, abuse or loss of liberty.

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        The healthy development of children is crucial to the future well-being of any society. Because
                        they are still developing, children are especially vulnerable, more so than adults, to poor
                        living conditions such as poverty, inadequate health care, nutrition, safe water, housing
                        and environmental pollution. These conditions threaten the future of
                        children, and therefore the future of the societies in which they live.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The full list of rights for children and young people under the age of 18 is set out in the
                        <strong>Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong>, the most accepted standard on
                        children’s rights in the world:
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children and young people have the same general human rights as adults and also specific
                            rights that recognize their special needs;</li>
                        <li>Children are neither the property of their parents nor are they
                            helpless objects of charity. They are human beings and are the subject of their own rights;
                        </li>
                        <li>Children’s rights include the right to health, education, family life, play and recreation,
                            an
                            adequate standard of living and to be protected from abuse and harm;</li>
                        <li>Children’s rights cover their developmental needs that change as the child grows up.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The importance of children’s rights</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are many reasons for singling out children's rights in a separate human rights Convention:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are neither the possessions of parents nor of the state, nor are they mere
                            people-in-the-making; they have equal status as the other members of the family;</li>
                        <li>Children start life as totally dependent beings.
                            They rely on adults for the nurture and guidance they need to grow towards
                            independence.
                            Such nurture is ideally found from adults in children's families, but when they
                            cannot meet children's needs, it is up to the State as the primary duty bearer to find an
                            alternative in the best interests of the child;</li>
                        <li>Children's views should be heard and considered in the political process. Without
                            special attention to the opinions of children, their views go unheard on the many important
                            issues that affect them now or will affect them in the future.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many changes in society are having a disproportionate, and often negative, impact on children.
                        Transformation of the family structure, globalization, climate change, digitalization, mass
                        migration, shifting employment patterns and a shrinking social welfare net in many countries, all
                        have strong impacts on children. The impact of these changes can be particularly devastating in
                        situations of armed conflict and other emergencies.
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>

                    <p>
                        Many children are being exploited through mentally and physically dangerous work that involves
                        hazardous workplaces and exploitative acts such as slavery, drug trafficking, prostitution and
                        armed conflict.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By providing education and resources to communities in need, we have the power to impact the
                        environment in which vulnerable children live.
                        Representing over 30 per cent of the world's population, children have the absolute right to
                        live in a decent environment with all that implies: attending school, having nutritious food,
                        enjoying good
                        health and living and growing in safety.
                    </p>
