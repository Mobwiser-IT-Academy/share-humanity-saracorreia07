                    <h3>Most Affected Areas</h3>
                    <p>In 2019, more than two-thirds of all refugees came from just five countries: 
                    <br>
                    Syria / Venezuela / Afghanistan / South Sudan / Myanmar 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Syria has been the main country of origin for refugees since 2014, and at the end of 2019, there were 6.6 million Syrian refugees hosted by 126 countries worldwide.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The world's top 10 refugee <strong>host countries</strong> are:
                    <br>
                    Turkey / Jordan / Colombia / Pakistan / Lebanon / Germany / Sudan / Uganda / Bangladesh / Iran
                    <br>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every day, all over the world, people make one of the most difficult decisions in their lives:
                        to leave their homes in search of a safer, better life. There are many reasons why people around
                        the globe seek to rebuild their lives in a different country:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Some people leave home to get a job or an education;</li>
                        <li>Others are forced to flee persecution or human rights violations such as torture;</li>
                        <li>Millions flee from armed conflicts or other crises or violence;</li>
                        <li>Some no longer feel safe and might have been targeted just because of who they are or what
                            they do or believe, for their ethnicity, religion, sexuality or political opinions;</li>
                        <li>Some people are forced to leave because of climate change or other
                            natural disasters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While on these journeys, which all start with the hope for a better future, there can also be
                        danger and fear:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Some people risk falling prey to human trafficking and other forms of exploitation;</li>
                        <li>Some are detained by the authorities as soon as they arrive in a new country;</li>
                        <li>Once they’re settling in and
                            start building a new life, many face daily racism, xenophobia and discrimination.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Who is a refugee?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A refugee is a person who has fled their own country because they are at risk of serious human
                        rights violations and persecution there. The risks to their safety and life were so great that
                        they had no choice but to leave and seek safety outside their country because their own
                        government cannot or will not protect them from those dangers. Once a person becomes a refugee,
                        they are likely to remain a refugee for many years. Many will be displaced for nearly two
                        decades.

                        <strong>Refugee Camps</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Refugees have a right to international protection. These refugee camps are temporary facilities
                        built to provide immediate protection and assistance to
                        people who have been forced to flee. While camps are not intended to provide permanent
                        sustainable solutions, they offer a safe haven for refugees, where
                        they receive medical treatment, food, shelter, and other basic services during emergencies.
                        There are refugee camps all over the world. Many of these camps were built quickly to serve the
                        immediate needs of those forced to flee, but have grown
                        to host hundreds of thousands of displaced people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Refugees in Europe</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The number of people seeking protection in Europe has grown considerably in recent years. As
                        conflicts and violence in other parts of the world fuel large-scale and protracted displacement,
                        some refugees are seeking safety beyond the immediate region. Many refugees and migrants
                        continue to take dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean. Many have lost their lives at sea
                        or seen loved ones drown while trying to reach safety.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The lack of a unified system to manage the influx of refugees and migrants is
                        exacerbating the problem. People are either welcomed or shunned. They can face fences of barbed
                        wire or cheering locals. Around 50,000 people are stranded in Greece, waiting to be relocated to
                        other European countries or sent back home.

                        <strong>UNHCR - the UN Refugee Agency</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The UNHCR is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a
                        better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people.
                        Since 1950, they have provided vital assistance to refugees asylum-seekers, internally displaced
                        and stateless people, many of whom have nobody left to turn to.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The protection of refugees has many aspects. These include safety from being returned to danger,
                        access to fair and efficient asylum procedures, and measures to ensure that their basic human
                        rights are respected while they secure a longer-term solution. UNHCR works around
                        the clock to accomplish all of this. However, climate change is magnifying the impact of other
                        threats that drive displacement, worsening
                        poverty and intensifying pressures on resources and governance in ways that can stoke conflict
                        and violence.
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>
                    <p>
                        Globally, there are 26 million refugees. 85% of refugees are being hosted in developing
                        countries. Over the past decade, just over 1 million refugees were resettled, compared to 3.9
                        million refugees who returned to their country. However, wealthier countries aren’t doing nearly
                        enough to share the cost of protecting people who have left everything behind. Appeals for
                        humanitarian assistance for refugees are consistently, and often,
                        severely underfunded.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Half of the refugees are children. In 2016, close to 100,300 refugee and migrant children
                        arrived in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Spain, and one in three was unaccompanied or separated
                        from their family. These children face many protection risks in Europe, including
                        detention,sexual and gender-based violence, further family separation, psychological distress
                        and security risks. These dangers are exacerbated when they are placed in inadequate reception
                        facilities and
                        cannot access appropriate care.
