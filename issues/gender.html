                    <h3>Most Affected Areas</h3>
                    <p>
                        No country has fully attained gender equality yet. Scandinavian countries like Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden lead the world in their progress toward closing the gender gap.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The greatest gender gaps are identified primarily in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. However, a number of countries in these regions, including Lesotho, South Africa, and Sri Lanka outrank the United States in gender equality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In terms of LGBTQ rights, same-sex sexual activity is a crime in 70 countries, and can get you a death sentence in nine countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. And even where these restrictive laws are not actually enforced, their very existence reinforces prejudice against LGBTQ people.

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gender equality is a human right that states that people of all genders have equal rights,
                        responsibilities and opportunities in all spheres of life. Everyone is affected by it: women,
                        men, trans and gender diverse people, children and families. It impacts people of all ages and
                        backgrounds.
                        <br>
                        We need gender equality urgently in order to prevent violence against women and girls, and have
                        a safer and healthier society. It is essential for economic prosperity, as it is intrinsically
                        linked to sustainable development. We need to enable women and men to make their own decisions related to
                        their own sexual and reproductive health, their age at marriage, timing of births, or use of
                        contraception. Also, recourse to harmful practices (such as female genital cutting) stands to be
                        improved with the achievement of gender equality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Equality between men and women exists when:</strong>
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Both sexes are able to share equally in the distribution of power and
                            influence;</li>
                        <li>Equal opportunities for financial independence through work or setting up
                            businesses exists;</li>
                        <li>Equal access to education and the opportunity to develop personal ambitions, interests and
                            talents exists;</li>
                        <li>Shared responsibility for the home and children is established; </li>
                        <li>Both are completely free 
                            from coercion, intimidation and violence, both at work and at home.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to acknowledge that gender inequality exists, and one critical aspect of
                        promoting gender equality is the empowerment of women, by identifying and redressing power
                        imbalances and giving women more autonomy to manage
                        their own lives. It doesn't mean that men and women become the same, only that access to
                        opportunities and life changes is not dependent on their sex.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Why is the gender equality issue so close to the LGBTQ rights?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First, gender equality is an human right, and when we speak about human rights without naming
                        specific groups suffering from violence and discrimination, the discussion makes no sense.
                        Second, the basis for homophobic and transphobic attitudes is the inequality between men and
                        women. Men and women are still depicted as two polar opposites that may
                        complement one another but are not equal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Traditional values include positive things, such as mutual support, love and protection, but not
                        discrimination. People around the world face violence, inequality, and sometimes torture or even execution, because of who they love, how they look, or who they are. Sexual orientation and
                        gender identity should never lead to discrimination or abuse, that are enhanced by unjust laws,
                        unequal treatment, censorship, medical abuses, discrimination in health and jobs and housing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hopefully, the traditional standards of what we believe to be masculinity and femininity are
                        changing. The ideas remain, but the actual experience of being a man and a woman is changing,
                        although slower than the world does, and people find it hard to make peace with that. It is
                        especially hard for
                        men, since they need to reconsider their understanding of what it means to be a man in a
                        traditional patriarchal culture.
                        <br>
                        This idea of what it means to be a man or a woman is so central to our identity because our first
                        identity is based on how we are taught to be a boy or a girl. That’s why, as we grow up and see
                        the situation changing, we lose confidence about our basic knowledge about our identity. It’s
                        easier to handle if we gradually arrive at the understanding that it is normal and that ideas
                        change.
                    </p>

                    <h2>People Affected</h2>
                    <p>
                        In too many countries, being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer means living with
                        daily discrimination. This discrimination could be based on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexual orientation;</li>
                        <li>Gender identity (how you define yourself, irrespective of your biological sex);</li>
                        <li>Gender expression (how you express your gender through your clothing, hair or make-up);</li>
                        <li>Sex characteristics (genitals, chromosomes, reproductive organs, or
                            hormone levels).</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The range of unequal treatment faced is extensive and damaging. It can also be life-threatening.
                        In all too many cases, LGBTQ people are harassed in the streets, beaten up and sometimes killed.
                        Bringing an end to homophobia and transphobia will save lives. By embracing LGBTQ people and
                        understanding their identities, we can learn how to remove many of the limitations imposed by
                        gender stereotypes. Removing them, sets everyone free to achieve their full potential, without
                        discriminatory social constraints.
